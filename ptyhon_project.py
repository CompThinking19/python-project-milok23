"""
this program is designed to get the user thinking about the issues of
online privacy. Companies collect all kinds of data on users, from the obvious
that you give when you make the account to the hidden data that is colected
on your behavior.  This program begins by asking the user to create an account
to get started even thoug it is not necissery for the program function. Many
websites and services requier people to create accounts to colect as much data
as possible. Another main aspect of this programm is for to view twitter post data
has been colected, they can view the most popular tweet of an account based on
favorites or retweets, or view 10 random tweets. This shows the user how easy it
can be to get and then manipulate their personal data. It is very easy to change the
csv data file to be of a particular user.
