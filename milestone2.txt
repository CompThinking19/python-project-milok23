Your program runs and it does what's expected, which is great. You're on the right path toward finishing this up. My concern from the previous milestone stands, however: it's not clear what the initial prompts are doing for the overall program. You're collecting a bunch of user data and then not doing anything with it. The facts you're listing are interesting, but they're easily googleable. What are you doing WITH CODE that's impossible to do otherwise?
