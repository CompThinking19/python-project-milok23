Online Privacy Python Project


Note: Requires pandas installed for python 
Online privacy is a major issue in today's world. Companies collect all kinds of data on their users and almost everything that happens on the internet is tracked. Often companies like google and Facebook use this data to sell ads to advertisers. This data can also be used maliciously to influence people, another part of this issue is that once something is on the internet it often stays there forever. If someone makes a post, tweet or uploads a picture it will stay on the internet and it might not be possible to remove in future especially if it spreads as you only have control over the original. There are plenty of cases of things people posted years ago surfacing and causing issues. The problem with the internet is that once you unleash something on it you lose control. Yet another aspect is the fact that it is very easy to look up people on the internet. Not only can you find social media profiles but where they live, work, went to school and more. People are more exposed in today's world than ever before, often unknowingly.
The program begins by forcing the user to create an account by entering information about themselves if they wish to proceed. This is done to emulate companies that force users to make an account before using their service. If you have ever done a google image search which has taken you to pinterest you know what I mean. While none of this data is required for the rest of the program it could in theory be sold to advertisers so you can receive targeted ads. It also gives the user interesting facts about online privacy. How much data is collected by companies. How much data is potentially worth, what are the consequences of giving up our privacy. As well as how accurate the data can potentially be.
A key part of this program was taking twitter user data which contained the tweets of the user. This data is in the form of a csv file and contains lots of information like name, text, date and time, language, number of favorites etc. The program then takes that data and allows the user to do various things to it. They can view the most popular tweet of the account, either based on the number of retweets or the number of favorites. They can also view a set of random tweets from that account. It is very easy to add additional csv files to the program from other accounts so it is possible to tailor it to the end user by using their own personal tweets. A future expansion could be adding a sentiment analysis component that would analyse the individual tweets to determine if they are positive, negative or neutral. Plotting this over time could give a sense of the users mood over a period of time. Unfortunately I did not have the time to add this feature. 
The whole point of this section is to show the user how easy it is to gather someones twitter data and analyse it. Once that data is gathered the user has lost control of it and it can no longer be deleted. The user needs to think about what if someone got their post history and did something nefarious with it like looking for an old teeth they forgot about to get them in trouble. Users need to think twice before posting something on the Internet and consider how this will look in the future.
