I renamed your file with a ".py" file extension, so it would run properly and give syntax highlighting. You have a good sense of the overall structure of this program it seems, and I think I understand where you're going with it. There will be a user class that will hold the information, etc. However, I don't really understand how that data is going to be used meaningfully within the game. How will giving that information improve play experience? I don't see an obvious way in on that here, so this is something we should talk about in person. Beyond my questions about how the data is going to be used, I think this is a great start. My questions, really, are about the concept and not about the code, which you're doing quite well on so far.
